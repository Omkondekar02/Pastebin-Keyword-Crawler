# Pastebin-Keyword-Crawler
This is a simple Python tool that automatically scrapes Pastebin's public archive to find pastes containing crypto-related keywords (like bitcoin, crypto, wallet, BTC, etc.) or Telegram links. The tool uses regular expressions to scan the content of each paste and stores any matches in a structured .jsonl file (JSON Lines format).
